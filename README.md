# AI-text-based-game-
Interactive text based game using AI using OpenAI with auditory and visual stimulus.
The project uses OpenAI, NLTK, playsound and other libraries.

Auditory stimuli include sound effects pertaining to the sentiments and story beats (Eg: A negative moral choice might result in an ominous sound effect).

Visual stimuli here are colored indicators of the setiment of text (Eg: A negative story snippet generated by the AI might be colored in red). Potential addition of dalle-2 images in conjunction with the story generated.

The model remembers the overall narrative and immoral choices may lead to a bad ending. The visual and audio stimuli are indicative of the overall story sentiment and help the player reach their preferred ending.
